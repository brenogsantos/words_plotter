Proverbs 1:1

Proverbs 1:11

Proverbs
1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, the

king of Israel.
2 These proverbs are to teach wisdom and instruction,
to teach words of insight,
3 that you may receive instruction in order to live
by doing what is right, just, and fair.
4 These proverbs are also to give wisdom to the
naive,
and to give knowledge and discretion to young
people.
5 Let wise people listen and increase their learning,
and let discerning people get guidance,
6 to understand proverbs, sayings,
and words of wise people and their riddles.
7 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge—
fools despise wisdom and instruction.
8 My son, hear the instruction of your father
and do not lay aside the rules of your mother;
9 they will be a graceful wreath for your head
and pendants hanging from your neck.
10 My son, if sinners try to entice you into their
sin,
refuse to follow them.
11 If they say, “Come with us,
let us lie in wait for blood,

Proverbs 1:12

ii

Proverbs 1:23

let us hide and attack innocent people for no
reason.
12 Let us swallow them up alive, like Sheol takes
away those who are healthy,
and make them like those who fall into the pit.
13 We shall find all kinds of valuable things;
we will fill our houses with what we steal from
others.
14 Throw in your lot with us;
we will all have one purse together.”
15 My son, do not walk down that road with them;
do not let your foot touch where they walk;
16 their feet run to evil
and they hurry to shed blood.
17 For it is useless to spread the net in the sight
of any bird.
18 These men lie in wait for their own blood—
they set an ambush for their own lives.
19 So are the ways of everyone who gains riches
by injustice;
unjust gain takes away the lives of those who
hold on to it.
20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
she raises her voice in the open places;
21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out,
at the entrance of the city gates she speaks,
22 “How long, you naive people, will you love
being naive?
How long, you mockers, will you delight in
mockery,
and how long, you fools, will you hate knowledge?
23 Pay attention to my correction;
I will pour out my thoughts to you;

Proverbs 1:24

iii

Proverbs 2:3

I will make my words known to you.
24 I have called, and you have refused to listen;
I reached out with my hand, but there was no
one who paid attention.
25 But you have ignored all my instruction
and paid no attention to my correction.
26 I will laugh at your calamity,
I will mock you when the terror comes—
27 when your fearful dread comes like a storm
and disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
when distress and anguish come upon you.
28 Then they will call upon me, and I will not
answer;
they will desperately call for me, but they will
not find me.
29 Because they hate knowledge
and did not choose the fear of Yahweh,
30 they would not follow my instruction,
and they despised all my correction.
31 They will eat the fruit of their ways,
and with the fruit of their schemes they will be
filled.
32 For the naive are killed when they turn away,
and the indifference of fools will destroy them.
33 But whoever listens to me will live in safety
and will rest secure with no fear of disaster.”

2

1 My son, if you receive my words

and treasure up my commandments with you,
2 make your ears pay attention to wisdom
and incline your heart to understanding.
3 If you cry out for understanding

Proverbs 2:4

iv

Proverbs 2:16

and raise your voice for it,
4 if you seek it like you would seek silver
and search for understanding as you would seek
hidden treasures,
5 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh
and you will find the knowledge of God.
6 For Yahweh gives wisdom,
from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
7 He stores up sound wisdom for those who
please him,
he is a shield for those who walk in integrity,
8 he guards the paths of justice
and he will preserve the way of those who are
faithful to him.
9 Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and equity,
and every good path.
10 For wisdom will come into your heart,
and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
11 Discretion will watch over you,
understanding will guard you.
12 They will rescue you from the way of evil,
from those who speak perverse things,
13 who abandon the right paths
and walk in the ways of darkness.
14 They rejoice when they do evil
and delight in the perversities of evil.
15 They follow crooked paths,
and using deception they hide their tracks.
16 Wisdom and discretion will save you from an
adulterous woman,

Proverbs 2:17

v

Proverbs 3:7

from an immoral woman and her flattering
words.
17 She forsakes the companion of her youth
and forgets the covenant of her God.
18 For her house leads down to death
and her tracks will lead you to those in the grave.
19 All who go in to her will not return again
and they will not find the paths of life.
20 So you will walk in the way of good people
and follow the paths of righteous people.
21 For those doing right will make a home in the
land,
and those with integrity will remain in it.
22 But the wicked will be cut off from the land,
and the faithless will be cut off from it.

3

1 My son, do not forget my commands

and keep my teachings in your heart,
2 for length of days and years of life
and peace they will add to you.
3 Do not let covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness ever leave you,
tie them together about your neck,
write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 Then you will find favor and a good reputation
in the sight of God and man.
5 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart
and do not lean on your own understanding;
6 in all your ways acknowledge him
and he will make your paths straight.
7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
fear Yahweh and turn away from evil.

Proverbs 3:8

vi

8 It will be healing to your flesh

Proverbs 3:22

and refreshment for your body.
9 Honor Yahweh with your wealth
and with the firstfruits of all your produce,
10 and your storehouses will be filled up
and your vats will be bursting, full of new wine.
11 My son, do not despise Yahweh's instruction
and do not hate his rebuke,
12 for Yahweh disciplines those he loves,
as a father deals with a son who pleases him.
13 The one who finds wisdom is blessed;
he also gets understanding.
14 What you gain from wisdom is better than
what silver will give in return
and its profit is better than gold.
15 Wisdom is more precious than jewels
and nothing you desire can compare to her.
16 She has length of days in her right hand;
in her left hand are riches and honor.
17 Her ways are ways of kindness
and all her paths are peace.
18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of
it,
those who hold on to it are happy.
19 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth,
by understanding he established the heavens.
20 By his knowledge the depths broke open
and the clouds dropped their dew.
21 My son, keep sound judgment and discernment,
and do not lose sight of them.
22 They will be life to your soul

Proverbs 3:23

vii

Proverbs 3:35

and an adornment of favor to wear around your
neck.
23 Then you will walk on your way in safety
and your foot will not stumble;
24 when you lie down, you will not be afraid;
when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
25 Do not be afraid of sudden terror
or devastation caused by the wicked, when it
comes,
26 for Yahweh will be on your side
and will keep your foot from being caught in a
trap.
27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve
it,
when it is in your power to act.
28 Do not say to your neighbor,
“Go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give
it,”
when you have the money with you.
29 Do not make a plan to harm your neighbor—
the one who lives close and trusts you.
30 Do not argue with a person without a reason,
when he has done nothing to harm you.
31 Do not envy a violent person
or choose any of his ways.
32 For the devious person is detestable to Yahweh,
but he brings the upright person into his confidence.
33 The curse of Yahweh is on the house of the
wicked person,
but he blesses the home of righteous people.
34 He mocks mockers,
but he gives his favor to humble people.
35 Wise people inherit honor,

Proverbs 4:1

viii

Proverbs 4:12

but fools will be lifted up in their shame.

4

1 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction,

and pay attention so you will know what understanding is.
2 I am giving you good instructions;
do not forsake my teaching.
3 When I was a son of my father,
the tender and only child of my mother,
4 he taught me and said to me,
“Let your heart hold fast to my words;
keep my commands and live.
5 Acquire wisdom and understanding;
do not forget and do not reject the words of my
mouth;
6 do not abandon wisdom and she will watch
over you;
love her and she will keep you safe.
7 Wisdom is the most important thing, so acquire
wisdom
and spend all you own so you can get understanding.
8 Cherish wisdom and she will exalt you;
she will honor you when you embrace her.
9 She will put a wreath of honor on your head;
she will give you a beautiful crown.”
10 Listen, my son, and pay attention to my words,
and you will have many years in your life.
11 I direct you in the way of wisdom;
I lead you down straight paths.
12 When you walk, no one will stand in your way
and if you run, you will not stumble.

Proverbs 4:13

ix

Proverbs 4:27

13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;

guard it, for it is your life.
14 Do not follow the path of the wicked
and do not go along the way of those who do evil.
15 Avoid it, do not go on it;
turn away from it and go another way.
16 For they cannot sleep until they do evil
and they are robbed of sleep until they cause
someone to stumble.
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness
and drink the wine of violence.
18 But the path of righteous people is like the first
light that grows brighter;
it shines more and more until the fullness of the
day comes.
19 The way of the wicked is like darkness—
they do not know what it is they stumble over.
20 My son, pay attention to my words;
incline your ear to my sayings.
21 Do not let them turn away from your eyes;
keep them in your heart.
22 For my words are life to those who find them
and health to their whole body.
23 Keep your heart safe and guard it with all
diligence,
for from it flow the springs of life.
24 Put crooked speech away from you
and put corrupt talk far from you.
25 Let your eyes look straight ahead
and fix your gaze straight before you.
26 Make a level path for your foot;
then all your ways will be secure.
27 Do not turn aside to the right or to the left;

Proverbs 5:1

x

Proverbs 5:13

turn your foot away from evil.

5

1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom;

incline your ears to my understanding,
2 so you may learn about discretion
and your lips may protect knowledge.
3 For the lips of an adulteress drip with honey
and her mouth is smoother than oil,
4 but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,
cutting like a sharp sword.
5 Her feet go down to death;
her steps go all the way to Sheol.
6 She gives no thought to the path of life.
Her footsteps wander; she does not know where
she is going.
7 Now, my sons, listen to me;
do not turn away from listening to the words of
my mouth.
8 Keep your path far away from her
and do not come near the door of her house.
9 In that way you will not give away your honor
to others
or years of your life to a cruel person;
10 strangers will not feast on your wealth;
what you have worked for will not go into the
house of strangers.
11 At the end of your life you will groan
when your flesh and your body waste away.
12 You will say, “How I hated instruction
and my heart despised correction!
13 I would not obey my teachers
or incline my ear to my instructors.

Proverbs 5:14

xi

Proverbs 6:1

14 I was almost completely ruined

in the midst of the assembly, among the gathering of the people.”
15 Drink water from your own cistern
and drink running water from your own well.
16 Should your springs overflow everywhere
and your streams of water flow in the public
squares?
17 Let them be for yourself alone
and not for strangers with you.
18 May your fountain be blessed
and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth,
19 for she is a loving deer and a graceful doe.
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
may you be continually intoxicated by her love.
20 For why should you, my son, be captivated by
an adulteress;
why should you embrace the breasts of an
immoral woman?
21 Yahweh sees everything a person does
and watches all the paths he takes.
22 A wicked person will be seized by his own
iniquities;
the cords of his sin will hold him tight.
23 He will die because he lacks instruction;
he is led astray by his great foolishness.
1 My

6

son, if you set aside your money as a
guarantee for your neighbor's loan,
if you gave your promise for a loan of someone
you do not know,

Proverbs 6:2

xii

Proverbs 6:14

2 then you have laid a trap for yourself by your

promise
and you have been caught by the words of your
mouth.
3 When you are caught by your words, my son,
do this and save yourself,
since you have fallen into the hand of your
neighbor;
go and humble yourself and make your case
before your neighbor.
4 Give your eyes no sleep
and your eyelids no slumber.
5 Save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of
the hunter,
like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
6 Look at the ant, you lazy person,
consider her ways, and be wise.
7 It has no commander,
officer, or ruler,
8 yet it prepares its food in the summer
and during the harvest it stores up what it will
eat.
9 How long will you sleep, you lazy person?
When will you rise from your sleep?
10 “A little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands to rest”—
11 and your poverty will come like a robber
and your needs like an armed soldier.
12 A worthless person—a wicked man—
lives by the crookedness of his speech,
13 winking his eyes, making signals with his feet
and pointing with his fingers.
14 He plots evil with deceit in his heart;

Proverbs 6:15

xiii

Proverbs 6:27

he always stirs up discord.
15 Therefore his disaster will overtake him in an
instant;
in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.
16 There are six things that Yahweh hates,
seven that are disgusting to him.
17 The eyes of a proud person, a tongue that lies,
hands that shed the blood of innocent people,
18 a heart that invents wicked schemes,
feet that quickly run to do evil,
19 a witness who breathes out lies
and one who sows discord among brothers.
20 My son, obey the command of your father
and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
21 Always bind them on your heart;
tie them about your neck.
22 When you walk, they will guide you;
when you sleep, they will watch over you;
and when you wake up, they will teach you.
23 For the commands are a lamp, and the
teaching is a light;
the corrections that come by instruction are the
way of life.
24 It keeps you from the immoral woman,
from the smooth words of an immoral woman.
25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes.
26 Sleeping with a prostitute can cost the price of
a loaf of bread,
but the wife of another may cost you your very
life.
27 Can a man carry a fire against his chest

Proverbs 6:28

xiv

Proverbs 7:4

without burning his clothes?
28 Can a man walk on hot coals
without scorching his feet?
29 So is the man who sleeps with his neighbor's
wife;
the one who sleeps with her will not go unpunished.
30 People do not despise a thief if he steals
to satisfy his need when he is hungry.
31 Yet if he is caught, he will pay back seven times
what he stole;
he must give up everything of value in his house.
32 The one who commits adultery has no sense;
the one who does it destroys himself.
33 Wounds and shame are what he deserves
and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
34 For jealousy makes a man furious;
he will show no mercy when he takes his
revenge.
35 He will accept no compensation
and he cannot be bought off, though you offer
him many gifts.

7

1 My son, keep my words

and store up my commands within yourself.
2 Keep my commands and live
and keep my instruction as the apple of your eye.
3 Tie them on your fingers;
write them on the tablet of your heart.
4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
and call understanding your kinsman,

Proverbs 7:5

xv

Proverbs 7:18

5 in order to keep yourself from the adulterous

woman,
from the immoral woman with her smooth
words.
6 At the window of my house
I was looking out through the lattice.
7 I looked at the naive people,
and I noticed among the young men
a youth who had no sense.
8 That young man passed down the street near
her corner,
and he went toward her house.
9 It was twilight, in the evening of the day,
at the time of night and darkness.
10 There a woman met him,
dressed like a prostitute, with a false heart.
11 She was loud and wayward;
her feet did not stay at home.
12 Now in the streets, then in the market place,
and at every corner she waited in ambush.
13 So she grabbed him and kissed him,
with a strong face she said to him,
14 “I made my peace offering today,
I paid my vows,
15 so came I out to meet you,
to eagerly seek your face, and I have found you.
16 I have spread coverings on my bed,
colored linens from Egypt.
17 I have sprinkled my bed
with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
18 Come, let us drink our fill of love until
morning;
let us take great pleasure in acts of love.

Proverbs 7:19

xvi

Proverbs 8:4

19 For my husband is not at his house;

he has gone on a long journey.
20 He took a bag of money with him;
he will return on the day of the full moon.”
21 With much talk she turned him;
with her smooth lips she misled him.
22 He went after her suddenly
like an ox going to slaughter,
like a deer caught in a trap, *
23 until an arrow pierces through its liver.
He was like a bird rushing into a snare.
He did not know that it would cost his life.
24 Now, my sons, listen to me;
pay attention to the words of my mouth.
25 May your heart not turn aside onto her paths;
do not be led astray onto her paths.
26 She has caused many people to fall down
pierced;
her dead victims are very many.
27 Her house is on the paths to Sheol;
they go down to the dark bedrooms of death.

1 Does not Wisdom call out?

Does not Understanding raise her voice?
2 On the hilltops beside the road,
at the crossroads, Wisdom has taken her stand.
3 Before the gates at the entrance into the city,
at the entrances into the city, she calls out.
4 “It is to you, people, that I call;
* 7:22 Deer could be a stag or an antelope. The Vulgate has:
lamb . The LXX has: like a dog to the muzzle .

Proverbs 8:5

xvii

Proverbs 8:18

my voice is for the sons of mankind.
5 You who are naive, learn wisdom;
and you who are foolish, you must get an
understanding mind.
6 Listen, because I will speak of noble things,
and when my lips open I will say upright things.
7 For my mouth speaks what is trustworthy,
and wickedness is disgusting to my lips.
8 All the words of my mouth are just;
in them is nothing twisted or misleading.
9 All of them are straight for the person who
understands;
my words are upright for those who find knowledge.
10 Acquire my instruction rather than silver;
acquire knowledge rather than pure gold.
11 For Wisdom is better than jewels;
no treasure is equal to her.
12 I, Wisdom, live with Prudence,
and I possess knowledge and discretion.
13 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.
I hate pride and arrogance, the evil way,
and perverted speech. I hate them.
14 I have good advice and sound wisdom;
I am insight; strength belongs to me.
15 By me kings reign, and rulers make laws that
are just.
16 By me princes rule,
nobles, and all who govern with justice.
17 I love those who love me,
and those who diligently seek me, find me.
18 With me are riches and honor,
lasting wealth and righteousness.

Proverbs 8:19

xviii

Proverbs 8:32

19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold;

my produce is better than pure silver.
20 I walk in the path of righteousness,
in the midst of the paths of justice.
21 As a result, I make those who love me inherit
wealth;
I fill up their treasuries.
22 Yahweh created me at the beginning,
the first of his deeds then.
23 In ages long ago I was made—from the first,
from the beginnings of the earth.
24 Before there were oceans, I was given birth—
before there were springs abounding with water.
25 Before the mountains were settled
and before the hills, I was born.
26 I was born before Yahweh had made the earth
or the fields,
or even the first dust in the world.
27 I was there when he established the heavens,
when he drew a circle on the surface of the deep.
28 I was there when he established the clouds
above and
when the springs in the deep became fixed.
29 I was there when he made his limit for the sea,
so the waters should not spread beyond his
command,
and when there was set the limit for the foundations of the dry land.
30 I was beside him, as a skilled craftsman;
I was his delight day after day,
always rejoicing before him.
31 I was rejoicing in his whole world,
and my delight was in the sons of mankind.
32 Now, my sons, listen to me,

Proverbs 8:33

xix

Proverbs 9:9

for those who keep my ways will be blessed.
33 Listen to my instruction and be wise;
do not neglect it.
34 The one who listens to me will be blessed.
He will be watching every day at my doors,
waiting beside the posts of my doors.
35 For whoever finds me, finds life,
and he will find the favor of Yahweh.
36 But he who fails, harms his own life;
all who hate me love death.”

1 Wisdom has built her own house;

she has carved seven pillars out of rocks.
2 She has slaughtered her animals; she has mixed
her wine;
and she has set her table.
3 She has sent out her maids; she calls out
from the highest points of the city,
4 “Who is naive? Let him turn aside here!”
To the one lacking good sense she speaks.
5 “Come, eat my food,
and drink the wine I have mixed.
6 Leave your naive actions and live;
walk in the path of understanding.
7 Whoever disciplines a mocker receives abuse,
and whoever rebukes a wicked person receives
insults.
8 Do not reprove a mocker, or he will hate you;
reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
9 Give to a wise person, and he will become even
wiser;
teach a righteous person, and he will add to his
learning.

Proverbs 9:10

xx

Proverbs 10:4

10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom,

and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
11 For through me your days will be multiplied,
and years of life will be added to you.
12 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself,
and if you mock, you will carry it by yourself.”
13 The woman of foolishness is ignorant;
she is untaught and knows nothing.
14 She sits at the door of her house,
on a seat in the highest places of the town.
15 She is calling out to those who pass by in the
streets,
to people walking straight on their way.
16 “Let anyone who is naive turn aside here,”
she says to those who have no sense.
17 “Stolen waters are sweet,
and bread of secrecy is delicious.”
18 But he does not know that the dead are there,
that her invited guests are in the depths of Sheol.

1 The proverbs of Solomon.

A wise son makes his father rejoice
but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
2 Treasures accumulated by wickedness have no
value,
but doing what is right keeps you from death.
3 Yahweh does not let the soul of the righteous
person go hungry,
but he frustrates the cravings of the wicked.
4 A lazy hand causes a person to be poor,
but the hand of the diligent person gains riches.

Proverbs 10:5

xxi

Proverbs 10:16

5 A wise son gathers a crop in the summer,

but it is disgraceful for him to sleep during
harvest.
6 Gifts from God are upon the head of the
righteous person,
but the mouth of the wicked covers up violence.
7 The righteous person makes those who remember him happy,
but the name of the wicked will rot away.
8 Those who are sensible accept commands,
but a talkative fool will come to ruin.
9 He who walks in integrity walks in safety,
but the one who makes his ways crooked, he will
be found out.
10 He who winks the eye causes grief,
but a talkative fool will be thrown down. *
11 The mouth of the righteous person is a water
spring of life,
but the mouth of the wicked covers up violence.
12 Hatred stirs up conflicts,
but love covers over all offenses.
13 Wisdom is found on the lips of a discerning
person,
but a rod is for the back of the one who has no
sense.
14 Wise men store up knowledge,
but the mouth of a fool brings destruction near.
15 The wealth of a rich man is his fortified city;
the poverty of the poor is their destruction.
16 The wage of the righteous person leads to life;
the profit of the wicked leads them to sin.
* 10:10

Some modern versions have but one who bravely
corrects makes peace .

Proverbs 10:17

xxii

Proverbs 10:28

17 There is a path to life for the one who follows

discipline,
but the one who rejects correction is led astray.
18 Whoever conceals hatred has lying lips,
and whoever spreads slander is a fool.
19 When there are many words, transgression is
not lacking,
but he who is careful in what he says is wise.
20 The tongue of the righteous person is pure
silver;
there is little value in the heart of the wicked.
21 The lips of the righteous person nourish many,
but fools die because of their lack of sense.
22 The good gifts of Yahweh bring wealth
and he adds no pain to it.
23 Wickedness is a game a fool plays,
but wisdom is a pleasure to a man of understanding.
24 The fear of the wicked person will overtake
him,
but the desire of righteous people will be
granted.
25 The wicked are like the storm that passes by,
and they are no more,
but the righteous person is a foundation that
lasts forever.
26 Like vinegar on the teeth and smoke in the
eyes,
so is the sluggard to those who send him.
27 The fear of Yahweh prolongs life,
but the years of the wicked will be short.
28 The hope of righteous people is their joy,
but the years of wicked people will be short.

Proverbs 10:29

xxiii

Proverbs 11:7

29 The way of Yahweh protects those who have

integrity,
but it is destruction for the wicked.
30 The righteous person will never be overthrown,
but the wicked will not remain in the land.
31 Out of the mouth of the righteous person
comes the fruit of wisdom,
but the perverse tongue will be cut out.
32 The lips of the righteous person know what is
acceptable,
but the mouth of the wicked, they know what is
perverse.

11

1 Yahweh hates scales that are not accurate,

but he delights in a precise weight.

16 Why should a fool pay money to learn about
wisdom,
when he has no ability to learn it?

and the hearing of the wise seeks it out.
16 A man's gift may open the way
and bring him before an important person.
17 The first to plead his case seems right
until his opponent comes and questions him.
18 Casting the lot settles disputes
and separates strong opponents.
19 An offended brother is harder to be won than
a strong city,
and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.
20 From the fruit of his mouth one's stomach is
filled;
with the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
21 Death and life are controlled by the tongue,
and those who love the tongue will eat its fruit.
22 He who finds a wife finds a good thing
and receives favor from Yahweh.

and he who breathes out lies will not escape.
6 Many will ask for a favor from a generous
person
and everyone is a friend of the one who gives
gifts.
7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him;
how much more do his friends who go far away
from him!
He calls out to them, but they are gone.
8 He who gets wisdom loves his own life;
he who keeps understanding will find what is
good.
9 A false witness will not go unpunished,

10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—
much less for a slave to rule over princes.

Yahweh made them both.
13 Do not love sleep or you will come to poverty;

18 Plans are established by advice

Proverbs 21:5

Wait for Yahweh and he will rescue you.
23 Yahweh hates unequal weights
and dishonest scales are not good.
24 A person's steps are directed by Yahweh;
how then can he understand his way?
25 It is a snare for a person to say rashly, “This
thing is holy,”
and begin to think about what it means only after
making his vow.
26 A wise king winnows the wicked
and he turns a threshing wheel over them.
27 The spirit of a person is the lamp of Yahweh,
searching all his inmost parts.
28 Covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness
preserve the king;
his throne is made secure by love.
29 The glory of young men is their strength
and the splendor of old people is their gray hair.
30 Blows that make a wound cleanse away evil
and beatings make the innermost parts clean.

1 The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand

of Yahweh;
he turns it wherever he pleases.
2 Every person's way is right in his own eyes,
but it is Yahweh who weighs the hearts.
3 To do what is right and just
is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.
4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
the lamp of the wicked—are sin.
5 The plans of the diligent lead only to prosperity,

poverty.
6 Acquiring riches by a lying tongue
is a fleeting vapor and a snare that kills.
7 The violence of the wicked will drag them away,
for they refuse to do what is just.
8 The way of a guilty person is crooked,
but the one who is pure does what is right.
9 It is better to live on a corner of the roof
than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.
10 The appetite of the wicked craves evil;
his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.
11 When the mocker is punished, the naive
become wise,
and when the wise person is instructed, he lays
hold of knowledge.
12 The righteous person watches the house of the
wicked person;
he brings wicked people to disaster.
13 The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the
poor,
he also will cry out, but he will not be answered.
14 A gift in secret appeases anger

15 When justice is done, it brings joy to the

Proverbs 21:29

18 A wicked person is ransom for the righteous

person,

19 It is better to live in the desert
than with a quarreling and angry wife.
20 Desirable treasure and oil are kept in the
dwelling of the wise,
but a foolish person swallows it all up.
21 The one who does right and is kind—
this person finds life, righteousness, and honor.
22 A wise man scales the city of the mighty ones,

trusted.
23 Whoever guards his mouth and tongue
keeps himself out of trouble.
24 The proud and haughty person—”Mocker” is

25 The desire of the lazy kills him,

26 All day long he craves and craves more,
but the righteous person gives and does not hold

27 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable;
it is even more detestable when he brings it with
evil motives.
28 A false witness will perish,

31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle,

1 A good name is to be chosen over great riches

and favor is better than silver and gold.
2 Rich and poor people have this in common—
Yahweh is the maker of all of them.
3 A prudent man sees trouble and hides himself,
but the naive go on and suffer because of it.
4 The reward for humility and fear of Yahweh
is riches, honor, and life.
5 Thorns and snares lie in the path of the
perverse;
whoever guards his life will keep far from them.
6 Teach a child the way he should go
and when he is old he will not turn away from

7 Rich people rule over poor people
and one who borrows is a slave to the one who
lends.
8 He who sows injustice will reap trouble
and the rod of his fury will fade away.
9 The one who has a generous eye will be blessed,
for he shares his bread with the poor.
10 Drive away the mocker, and out goes strife;
disputes and insults will cease.

and whose speech is gracious,
he will have the king for his friend.

Proverbs 22:24

12 The eyes of Yahweh keep watch over knowl-

edge,
but he overthrows the words of the treacherous.
13 The lazy person says, “There is a lion in the
street!
I will be killed in the open places.”
14 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit;
Yahweh's anger is stirred up against anyone who
falls into it.
15 Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child,
but the rod of discipline drives it far away.
16 The one who oppresses poor people to increase
his wealth,
or gives to rich people, will come to poverty.
17 Incline your ear and listen to the words of the
wise
and apply your heart to my knowledge,
18 for it will be pleasant for you if you keep them
within you,
if all of them are ready on your lips.
19 So your trust may be in Yahweh,
I teach them to you today—even to you.
20 Have I not written for you thirty sayings
of instruction and knowledge,
21 to teach you truth in these trustworthy words,
so you may give trustworthy answers to those
who sent you?
22 Do not rob the poor because he is poor,
or crush the needy at the gate,
23 for Yahweh will plead their case,

by anger
and you must not go with one who rages,

what could stop someone from taking away your
bed from under you?
28 Do not remove the ancient boundary stone
that your fathers have set.
29 Do you see a man skilled at his work? He will
stand before kings;

observe carefully what is before you,

3 Do not crave his delicacies,

4 Do not work too hard to gain wealth;
be wise enough to know when to stop.
5 Will you let your eyes light upon it?
It will be gone,
for it will surely take up wings like an eagle
and fly off to the sky.
6 Do not eat the food of one with an evil eye—

12 Apply your heart to instruction
and your ears to words of knowledge.
13 Do not withhold instruction from a child,
for if you discipline him, he will not die.
14 It is you who must beat him with the rod

15 My son, if your heart is wise,
then my heart also will be glad;

17 Do not let your heart envy sinners,
but continue in the fear of Yahweh all the day.
18 Surely there is a future
and your hope will not be cut off.
19 Hear—you!—my son, and be wise
and direct your heart in the way.
20 Do not associate with drunkards,
or with gluttonous eaters of meat,

3 Through wisdom a house is built
and by understanding it is established.
4 By knowledge the rooms are filled
with all precious and pleasant riches.
5 A warrior of wisdom is strong,
and a man of knowledge increases his strength;
6 for by wise direction you can wage your war
and with many advisors there is victory.
7 Wisdom is too high for a fool;
in the gate he does not open his mouth.
8 There is one who plans to do evil—
people call him a master of schemes.
9 A foolish plan is sin
and men despise a mocker.
10 If you become weak with fear in the day of
trouble,
then your strength is small.
11 Rescue those who are being taken away to
death
and hold back those who are staggering to the
slaughter.

if you find it, there will be a future
and your hope will not be cut off.
15 Do not lie in wait like the wicked person
who attacks the house of the righteous person.
Do not destroy his home!
16 For the righteous person falls down seven
times and rises again,
but wicked people are brought down by calamity.
17 Do not celebrate when your enemy falls
and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,
18 or Yahweh will see and disapprove
and turn away his wrath from him.
19 Do not worry because of evildoers,
and do not envy wicked people,
20 for the evil person has no future
and the lamp of wicked people will go out.
21 Fear Yahweh, and fear the king, my son;
do not associate with those who rebel against
them,
22 for suddenly their disaster will come
and who knows the extent of the destruction that
will come from both of them?
23 These also are sayings of the wise.
Partiality in judging a case at law is not good.

29 Do not say, “I will do to him what he has done

30 I went by the field of a lazy man,
past the vineyard of the man having no sense.
31 Thorns had grown up everywhere,
the ground was covered with nettles,

I looked and received instruction.

6 Do not honor yourself in the king's presence

7 It is better for him to say to you, “Come up

9 Argue your case between you and your neighbor himself
and do not disclose another's secret,
10 or else the one who hears you will bring shame
upon you
and an evil report about you that cannot be
silenced.
11 Apples of gold in settings of silver

but a wise man holds it back and calms himself
down.
12 If a ruler pays attention to lies,
all his officials will be wicked.
13 The poor person and the oppressor are similar,
for Yahweh gives light to the eyes of them both.
14 If a king judges the poor by the truth,
his throne will be established forever.
15 The rod and reproof give wisdom,
but a child freed from discipline puts his mother
to shame.
16 When wicked people are in power, transgression increases,
but righteous people will see the downfall of
those wicked people.
17 Discipline your son and he will give you rest;
he will bring delights into your life.
18 Where there is no prophetic vision the people
run wild,
but the one who keeps the law is blessed.
19 A slave will not be corrected by words,
for though he understands, there will be no
response.
20 See a man who is hasty in his words?
There is more hope for a fool than for him.
21 One who pampers his slave from youth,

Proverbs 29:22

lxix

Proverbs 30:4

at the end of it there will be trouble.
22 An angry person stirs up strife
and a master of rage commits many sins.
23 A person's pride brings him low,
but one who has a humble spirit will be given
honor.
24 One who shares with a thief hates his own life;
he hears the curse and says nothing.
25 The fear of man makes a snare,
but the one who trusts in Yahweh will be
protected.
26 Many are those who seek the face of the ruler,
but from Yahweh is justice for a person.
27 An unjust man is an abomination to righteous
people,
but the one whose way is upright is detestable to
the wicked person.

1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh—the utter-

ance:
This man declared to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal: *
2 Surely I am more like an animal than any
human
and I do not have the understanding of a human
being.
3 I have not learned wisdom,
nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.
4 Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
Who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of
his hands?
Who has gathered up the waters in a cloak?
* 30:1 Some versions have This man declared, “I am weary, O
God, I am weary. I am unable to do anything.”

Proverbs 30:5

lxx

Proverbs 30:15

Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name, and what is the name of his
son? Surely you know!
5 Every word of God is tested;
he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
6 Do not add to his words,
or he will discipline you,
and you will be proved to be a liar.
7 Two things I ask of you,
do not withhold them from me before I die:
8 Put vanity and lies far away from me.
Give me neither poverty nor riches,
just give me the food I need.
9 For if I have too much, I might deny you and
say, “Who is Yahweh?”
Or if I become poor,
I might steal and profane the name of my God.
10 Do not slander a slave before his master,
or he will curse you and you will be held guilty.
11 There is a generation that curses their father
and does not bless their mother.
12 There is a generation that is pure in their own
eyes,
and yet they are not washed of their filth.
13 There is a generation whose eyes are raised
up,
and how high are their eyelids lifted up!
14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords,
and their jawbones are like knives,
so they may devour the poor from the earth and
the needy from among humanity.
15 The leech has two daughters: “Give and give”
they cry.

Proverbs 30:16

lxxi

Proverbs 30:26

There are three things that are never satisfied,
four that never say, “Enough”:
16 Sheol; the barren womb;
land that is never satisfied with water;
and the fire that never says, “Enough!”
17 The eye that mocks a father
and scorns obedience to a mother,
his eyes will be pecked out by the ravens of the
valley,
and he will be eaten by the vultures.
18 There are three things that are too wonderful
for me,
four that I do not understand:
19 the way of an eagle in the sky;
the way of a snake on a rock;
the way of a ship in the heart of the sea;
and the way of a man with a young woman.
20 This is the way of an adulteress:
she eats and she wipes her mouth
and says, “I have done nothing wrong.”
21 Under three things the earth trembles,
and under four it cannot bear up:
22 a slave when he becomes king;
a fool when he is filled with food;
23 a hated woman when she marries;
and a maid when she takes the place of her
mistress.
24 Four things on earth are small
and yet they are very wise:
25 the ants are creatures that are not strong,
but they prepare their food in the summer;
26 the rock badgers are not mighty creatures,
but they make their homes in the rocks.

Proverbs 30:27

lxxii

Proverbs 31:5

27 Locusts have no king,

but all of them march in rank.
28 As for the lizard, you can hold it in your two
hands,
yet they are found in kings' palaces.
29 There are three things that are stately in their
stride
and four that are stately in how they walk:
30 a lion, strongest among wild animals—
it does not turn away from anything;
31 a strutting rooster; a goat;
and a king whose soldiers are beside him.
32 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
or if you have been devising evil—
put your hand over your mouth.
33 As churning milk makes butter
and as one's nose will produce blood if it is
twisted,
so deeds done in anger produce conflict.

31

1 The words of King Lemuel—an instruction his

mother taught him.
2 What, my son? What is it, son of my womb?
What do you want, son of my vows?
3 Do not give your strength to women,
or your ways to those who destroy kings.
4 It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to
drink wine,
or for rulers to crave strong drink,
5 because when they drink they forget what has
been decreed,
and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.

Proverbs 31:6

lxxiii

Proverbs 31:20

6 Give strong drink to a person who is perishing

and wine to those in bitter distress.
7 He will drink and he will forget his poverty
and he will not remember his trouble.
8 Speak for those who cannot speak,
for the causes of all who are perishing.
9 Speak out and judge by the measure of what is
right
and plead the cause of poor and needy people.
10 Who can find a capable wife?
Her value is far more than jewels.
11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,
and he will never be poor.
12 She does good things for him and not evil
all the days of her life.
13 She selects wool and flax,
and works with the delight of her hands.
14 She is like the merchant ships;
she brings her food from far away.
15 She rises while it is night
and gives food to her household,
and she distributes the work for her female
servants.
16 She considers a field and buys it,
with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
17 She dresses herself with strength
and makes her arms strong.
18 She perceives what will make a good profit for
her;
all night long her lamp is not extinguished.
19 She puts her hands on the spindle,
and she holds the twisting thread.
20 She reaches out with her hand to poor people;

Proverbs 31:21

lxxiv

Proverbs 31:31

she reaches out with her hands to needy people.
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household,
for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
22 She makes coverings for her bed,
and she wears clothes of fine purple linen.
23 Her husband is known at the gates,
when he sits with the elders of the land.
24 She makes linen garments and sells them,
and she supplies sashes to the merchants.
25 She is clothed with strength and honor,
and she laughs at the time to come.
26 She opens her mouth with wisdom
and the law of kindness is on her tongue.
27 She watches over the ways of her household
and does not eat the bread of idleness.
28 Her children rise up and call her blessed,
and her husband praises her, saying,
29 “Many women have done well,
but you surpassed them all.”
30 Elegance is deceptive, beauty is vain,
but a woman who fears Yahweh, she will be
praised.
31 Give her the fruit of her hands
and let her works praise her in the gates.
